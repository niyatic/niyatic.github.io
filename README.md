# work in progress -- Niyati Chhaya

I am a AI researcher with a focus on Natural language processing and multimodal content understanding. My research interests include natural language understanding, generative ai, computer vision (especially for document understanding), affective content analysis, and multimodal machine learning. I am passionate about exploring new ML/NLP approaches to solve real world problems while pushing the innovation in the foundational research space. 

I recently ventured into the start up world and am exploring organizations and roles where I bring in my AI and NLP expertise to practice. Prior to my current engagement, I spent over a decade at Adobe Research India as a research scientist in the lab. At Adobe, my most recent role also involved leading the Document Experiences team focusing on research towards document intelligence and doctument transformations. 

I also enjoy teaching and am a visiting faculty at the ISB, Hyderabad as well as IIIT Hyderabad. I consistently take guest lectures at several venues and mentor students. I am passionate about academic collaborations and have been lucky to have great collaborators across the world along the way. (Feel free to reach out)

Prior to joining Adobe Research in 2013, I received my PhD from the Univeristy of Maryland Baltimore County under Dr. Tim Oates with a focus on combining language and vision using probabilitistic graphical models. I received my undergraduate degree from the University of Pune, India in 2008, prior to joining grad school for masters and PhD. 

Research interests: 
natural language processing, gen ai, document intelligence, computational linguistics, multimodal content analysis - document and content transformations, affective content, collaborative creativity, machine learning, automl for nlp
